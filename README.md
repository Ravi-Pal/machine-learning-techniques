##  Machine-Learning Techniques

___
### What youâ€™ll learn



* Demonstrating in-depth understanding of machine learning algorithms - model, objective or loss function, optimization algorithm and evaluation criteria.

* Tweaking machine learning algorithms based on the outcome of experiments - what steps to take in case of underfitting and overfitting.

* Being able to choose among multiple algorithms for a given task.

* Developing an understanding of unsupervised learning techniques.
